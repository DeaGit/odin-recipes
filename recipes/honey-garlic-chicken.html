        <li>Place chicken pieces in a large bowl, add cornstarch, and toss to combine.</li>
        <li>Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select the Saute function. <br>Add oil until hot. Add 1/2 the chicken and cook for 3 minutes. Flip and cook 2 more minutes. <br>Transfer chicken to a plate and repeat with remaining chicken. Pour chicken broth into the empty Instant Pot® <br>and cook for 2 minutes, scraping up the brown bits with a wooden spoon to deglaze the pot. <br>Turn Instant Pot® off. Return chicken to the pot and pour honey mixture on top. Stir to coat with sauce.</li>

        <li>Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. <br>Unlock and remove the lid. Serve chicken sprinkled with green onions and sesame seeds.</li>
